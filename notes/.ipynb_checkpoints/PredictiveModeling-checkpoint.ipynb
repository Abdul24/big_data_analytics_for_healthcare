    "## Prediction Target\n",
    "We will focus on predicting heart failure, which lies in the sweet spot of both interesting, and possible to solve problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Motivations For Early Detection of Heart Failure\n",
    "1. Heart failure is a complex disease\n",
    "2. Reduce costs and hospitilizations\n",
    "3. Slow disease progression\n",
    "4. Improve existing clinical guidelines for preventing heart failur\n",

    "### Cohort Construction (study design)\n",
    "* There exists a subset of the population for which our study will be valid.\n",
    "* We should keep in mind that we probably won't have data for this entire subset, but our data should come from this subset.\n",

    "    * Target: Heart Failure Readmission\n",

    "* The length of the `observation window` and `prediction window` can heavily influence model performance.\n",
    "    * Large observation window and small prediction window are easiest to model.\n",
    "    * Small observation window, and large prediction window is the most useful (powerful) model, but most difficult to construct.\n",
